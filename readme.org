* Orgmark
Orgmark is a simple command line tool to support using an org mode file as a bookmark database.
Its key features are:
1. Adding new bookmarks on the command line.
2. Printing the bookmark list in format suitable for scripts, or as input to tools like dmenu or rofi.
** CLI Use
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Add a bookmark
orgmark --dir <boorkmarks.org-path> add <name> <url>
# Print bookmarks
orgmark --dir
#+END_SRC
It is mandatory to specify ~--dir~.
** Building
Orgmark can be built by running ~make~. The build requires sbcl with quicklisp installed. If you use Nix, you can use the provided ~shell.nix~ file to install the necessary dependencies before running ~make~.
** Why
Storing bookmarks in an org mode enables:
- writing notes directly under bookmarks
- referencing bookmarks in other org-mode files
- easily backing up pages with tools such as org-shelf
- easily sharing bookmarks between devices with file syncing tools
